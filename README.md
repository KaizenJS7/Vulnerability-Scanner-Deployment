<h1>How to Get Windows Image</h1>

Before we start, we will need Windows 10 Image. I would suggest you to use the official Microsoft Website. They have the option to create Windows 10 installation media and during the process you can choose one of the options to be an image in ISO format. So let's download the Windows 10 installation media to get our Windows 10 Image.

Click on Download Now. After it's downloaded lets open it.

The process of setting up Windows 10 Image is pretty straightforward. It's just a few steps. In here, I will just accept the license terms I am given.

Now let's wait untill it has downloaded and after that we'll go through the process of installing this on VirtualBox.

<h2>Installation of Windows on VirtualBox</h2>

Once downloaded on your computer lets go on and start the installation process.

First open VirtualBox and click on new.

<b>NAME AND OPERATING SYSTEM</b>

Next we have to select our Name, Folder, and ISO Image location. Let's give it a approriate name, I will type Nessus. For the folder select a disk image that has enough space. I would recommend at least 50GB for the Windows. Finally, you have to find the ISO Image we downloaded from Microsoft. In here we also have the unattended installation process. If you click on Skip, you will be prompted to manually configure different installation settings such as language, time zone, and user accounts. Using unattended installation allows us to put all necessary details at the beginning and then the process of installation is automatic.

<b>UNATTENDED INSTALL</b>

Select your Username and Password for the Windows 10. Put here something that you will remember because we will use it later. The same applies for the domain name and host name. Finally select Guest Additions. This allows us to change the resolution later and copy and paste between the VM and our enviroment.

</b>HARDWARE</b>

The minimal requirements for the memory if four gigabytes. Since I have a bit more of space, I'll use eight. For the processor, the more you give it, the faster the virtual machine will be. I''m going to go with three CPUs here.

<b>HARD DISK</b>

Here we have to create a virtual hard disk with appropriate size. The minimum recommended size is 25GB. I'll use 50GB to be sure that everything works fine.

After click Finsh.

I already had Windows 10 installed, but it should look something like this.
